    <h4>Selection Bias</h4>
    <p>Selection bias is likely one of the more (if not the most) common threats to the internal validity of a study. The idea here is that the sample of participants is not truly a random and representative sample. (I.e., not every possible participant has an equal chance of being selected for the study and certain groups will be overreprsented while other groups may not be represented at all.) Two common practices that create this type of bias are convenience sampling and voluntary response sampling.</p>
    
    <p><span class="dt">Convenience sampling</span> refers to the practice of only using as your sample pool participants who are easy to reach; <span class="dt">voluntary response sampling</span> allows participants to opt in to your study. Unfortunately, these both may skew results, and yet are also common practices in many of the social sciences. Take a psychological experiment, for example: we allow convenience sampling by drawing from the pool of students currently enrolled in an introductory psych course. This pool of participants is neither representative of the university as a whole, nor necessarily generalizable across other universities or to the national population as a whole. Further, these students are usually allowed to choose the studies in which they would like to participate, resulting in voluntary response sampling.</p>
    
    <p>Although neither is necessarily enough to skew the results of a study to the point of it being flatly wrong, considerations such as these do limit the generalizability of one's study. (We'll discuss this more in depth below under the <span class="dt">Sample Limitations</span> heading.)</p>
    
    <p>When conducting a study, there are various strategies that you can use to help ensure a representative sample is chosen. A brief list of these includes:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><span class="dt">Simple Random Sampling</span> &mdash; This implies that everyone in a population has an equal probability of being selected. For instance, say that we want to choose 100 students out of a university with 2000 students. A way to simple randomly sample these students would be to put every student's name into a hat and draw 100 names at random without replacemens (i.e., not putting a name back into the hat after it has been drawn). This would give any individual student a 1-in-20 (5%) chance of being selected.</li>
