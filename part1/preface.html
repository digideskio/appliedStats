    <h3>About the Author</h3>
    <p>Christopher Wetherill is currently a PhD student in Virginia Tech's <a href="http://www.tbmh.vt.edu" target="_blank">Translational Biology, Medicine, and Health</a> program. He received his undergraduate degree from John Carroll University. He has consulted with individuals and nonprofits on experimental design and statistical analyses since 2012. He recently edited <em><a href="https://infoactive.co/ebook" target="_blank">Data. Design. A simple introduction to preparing and visualizing information.</a></em>, a Creative Commons-licensed ebook detailing best practices for survey design and data collection and presentation.</p>
    
    <h3>Structure of the Book</h3>
    <p>This book is split into four main sections: an introduction to statistical inference; regression tools; comparisons of means among several samples; and working with unusual data structures. By and large, no part or chapter requires any existing knowledge of any previous part of chapter. The one exception to this is the introductory material: if you are not comfortable with the basic ways in which we quantify uncertainty, then you will struggle with the rest of the material. If you do not have a firm grip of the basics of statistical inference, or if you haven't thought about this in a while, you should probably take an afternoon to refresh yourself.</p>
    <p>Each chapter in this book follows the same general structure: we begin with an introduction to the topic and considerations of when and how a given test should be applied, what are its limitations, and what conditions it assumes are met. We then provide a sample case study, including all relevant background information and a complete analysis and write-up of the data. Finally, we include a summary of how to implement the test using the statistical software R and conclude with a number of comprehension exercises and data sets to be analyzed.</p>
