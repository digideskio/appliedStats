    <h1>Introduction to R</h1>
    <br />
    
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Installing R, RStudio</h3>
    <p>Although this software isn't required, we do recommend that you use R. It's what we will be using to carry out analyses in all of our examples and what we will use to analyze data in the end-of-chapter exercises. Although there won't be any major differences using other statistical software, occasionally you may obtain different results than we do.</p>
    
    <p>To install R, select any of <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html" target="_blank">the available download mirrors</a> from its website. Select the version that is appropriate for your operating system&mdash;Windows, Mac OS, or a Linux distribution. You may also wish <a href="http://www.rstudio.com" target="_blank">to install RStudio</a>. You will be fine if you don't install it; however, it pretties up R's graphical interface and makes working with data a bit easier for newcomers to the software. To use RStudio, you <strong>must</strong> have R installed on your computer already: installing RSTudio <strong>does not</strong> also install R.</p>
    
    <h3>Reading in Data</h3>
    <p>There are two strategies used for reading in data: the command line or RStudio's graphical interface. To load data via the command line, we will type a command such as:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
# Here, myData is what we will name our data once we load it.
# We use the function read.csv to tell R to load our data
# from the path specified. If you aren't sure where your
# working directory is, type the function getwd()
# and hit Enter.
myData <- read.csv("/Path/to/File.csv", headers=TRUE)
      </code>
    </pre>
